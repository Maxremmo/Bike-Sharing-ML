# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Background

Bike sharing systems represent a new generation of bike rentals where the entire process, from membership and rental to return, is automated. Users can easily rent a bike from one location and return it to another. There are now over 500 bike-sharing programs worldwide, comprising more than 500,000 bicycles. These systems play a vital role in addressing traffic congestion, environmental concerns, and promoting healthier lifestyles. Moreover, the data generated by these systems is of great interest for research, as it includes explicit information about travel duration, departure and arrival positions, effectively creating a virtual sensor network for monitoring urban mobility.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

  - EDA: This folder contains notebooks and scripts for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where you can delve into data exploration, visualization, and understanding.

  - Regression: In this folder, you will find notebooks and scripts related to bike-sharing demand prediction using regression techniques. These include models for predicting bike rental counts on an hourly or daily basis based on various factors.
  
  - Visualization: The Visualization folder is the highlight of this project. It features an interactive map that displays the real-time positions of bikes in Washington D.C. Every time the map is reloaded, it updates to reflect the current bike locations, enhancing the user's understanding of bike-sharing dynamics in the city.

## Interactive Map

The interactive map in this project is a unique and engaging feature. It allows you to visualize the real-time positions of bikes in Washington D.C., providing valuable insights into live bike-sharing patterns and availability. While the regression tasks are based on historical data from 2011 and 2012, the interactive map presents current data, giving users a real-time perspective on bike-sharing activity in the city.

Feel free to explore, analyze, and contribute to this project, with special attention to the captivating interactive map in the Visualization folder!


## Data Set

This project revolves around predicting bike-sharing rental demand, which is highly influenced by various environmental and seasonal factors, such as weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, and time of day. The core data set used for regression tasks in this project is derived from the two-year historical log of the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C., USA, covering the years 2011 and 2012. This publicly available dataset is aggregated on both an hourly and daily basis and augmented with weather and seasonal information. Weather data is sourced from Freemeteo.

Note: The regression tasks are based on historical data from 2011 and 2012. The interactive map is in real-time!
